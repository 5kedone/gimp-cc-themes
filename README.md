GIMP CC Theme
===

[ Backported from GIMP 2.9.2 themes for use with GIMP 2.8.18 and above. Will no longer be supported after this release. ]

Collection of three themes i created to give GIMP 2.8.x a similar look and feel as you'd find in Photoshop.  


Install
===


Copy the theme folders to the locations here depending on your OS :  

Windows: C:\Users\<your user name>\.gimp-2.8\themes  

Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.8/themes   or   ~/.gimp-2.8/themes  
   * (You may have to unhide the Library folder first)  

Linux: ~/.gimp-2.8/themes   or   /home/<your user name>/.gimp-2.8/themes  


Note
===


* The PS style icons i believe are from Martin Owens (at http://gimpstuff.org/content/show.php/Toolbox+Icons+like+Photoshop?content=159292) though i got theme through another theme.
* To have similar keyboard shortcuts copy the ps_menurc to your personal .gimp-2-8 folder and rename it to menurc (original available at http://epierce.freeshell.org/gimp/gimp_ps.php).
* Lifehacker has a nice article on making GIMP closer to Photoshop http://lifehacker.com/how-to-make-the-gimp-work-more-like-photoshop-1551318983 .
* Make the toolbar icons smaller by add the line after the colon to the beginning of the gtkrc file for the desired theme : gtk-icon-sizes = "gtk-small-toolbar=16,16:gtk-large-toolbar=16,16"
